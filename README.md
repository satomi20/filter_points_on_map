# Filter points on the map
Given a JSON object in the *pins file.json*. The object contains an array of "services" and an array of points with coordinates. Each point refers to a service.

##### You need to write an application that:
1. Can convert a given JSON object into a Kotlin/Java object.
2. Contains a screen with a map (*MapActivity*) on which points are displayed.
3. There is a button on the map screen that opens a second screen with a list of services (*Filter Activity*).
4. On *Filteractivity*, you can select services (one or more) for which points will be displayed on *MapActivity*.
